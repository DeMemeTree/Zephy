# Zephy

## Description
Zephy is an iOS application designed to be a private secure wallet for Zeph/ZSD/ZRS ecosystem. This application aims to be an opensource project that I take and host on the appstore with my LLC. Anyone can contribute and I dont intend to put any ADs or put it in the app store for any money. In other words I want it to be free. I want it to be dank. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Getting Started
Currently things are a little bit more manual than I would like

The Two commands Im currently running
```bash
./build_zephyr_all.sh
```

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Once both of those commands are run then I run the following

Building the ZephySDK Framework
```bash
xcodebuild -project ZephySDK.xcodeproj -scheme ZephySDK -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos
```
You can find the framework in the derived data folder, which you can copy into the Zephy project.

The library is not created in a way that it works in the simulator. You could in theory tweak things to setup it as such but I am just testing on my phone.

## Contributing
Just raise a PR if I find it to be useful or dank then I will merge it in.
